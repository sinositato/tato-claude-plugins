description: Generate interactive UI prototypes from PRD using frontend-design principles. Creates distinctive, production-grade HTML/CSS/JS prototypes with bold aesthetic choices.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Generate interactive visual UI prototypes from a PRD using the `frontend-design` skill's principles. Extract context from the PRD, ask targeted questions about components and design preferences, then produce production-quality HTML prototypes with distinctive, context-specific aesthetics.

**Design Methodology:** This skill applies the exact design thinking and aesthetics guidelines from the `frontend-design` skill (claude-plugins-official/frontend-design) to create distinctive, production-grade interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Resolve PRD Path

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, abort with: "Please provide a path to a PRD file. Example: `/prd-ui-prototype prd/my-feature/prd.md`"
- Validate the path exists and is a markdown file
- Extract the feature name from the path (e.g., `prd/user-auth/prd.md` → `user-auth`)

### 2. Read PRD Context

Read the PRD file using the Read tool and extract:

- **User Stories** — List of personas and their goals
- **Functional Requirements** — Features and capabilities to implement
- **User Flows** — Step-by-step interaction sequences
- **Design Guidelines** — Visual direction, branding, accessibility requirements
- **Platform/Technology** — Web, mobile, desktop, framework constraints

Create an internal summary of:
- Key components mentioned (forms, modals, dashboards, navigation, etc.)
- Target platforms (web, mobile-web, native mobile, desktop)
- Existing design constraints or brand guidelines

### 3. Interactive Discovery

**IMPORTANT**: Before asking questions, first check for existing prototypes and read previous design choices (this is Step 3.5-3.7 in execution order, but conceptually happens before asking questions).

Use AskUserQuestion to gather UI-specific requirements.

**Question 1: Component Selection**
- Header: "Components"
- Question: "Which components do you want to prototype?"
- Multi-select: true
- Options:
  - Dynamically extract from PRD (look for: login form, dashboard, settings panel, navigation bar, user profile, etc.)
  - Always include option: "All major components identified in PRD"
  - Always include option: "Let me specify custom components"

If user selects "Let me specify custom components", ask a follow-up text question for the component list.

**Question 2: Fidelity Level**
- Header: "Fidelity"
- Question: "What level of fidelity do you want for these prototypes? {PREVIOUS_CHOICE_SUFFIX}"
- Multi-select: false
- Options:
  - "Low fidelity - Wireframes" (description: "Basic layout and structure, minimal styling, grayscale")
  - "Medium fidelity - Styled mockups (Recommended)" (description: "Full color, typography, spacing - looks polished but not fully interactive")
  - "High fidelity - Production-ready" (description: "Pixel-perfect, fully styled, ready to integrate into codebase")

**{PREVIOUS_CHOICE_SUFFIX}**: If previous fidelity was detected from design-spec.md, append to question: "(Previous: {fidelity})"

**Question 3: Aesthetic Direction**
- Header: "Aesthetic"
- Question: "What aesthetic direction should the prototypes follow? {PREVIOUS_CHOICE_SUFFIX}"
- Multi-select: false
- Options:
  - "Let designer decide based on PRD context (Recommended)" (description: "frontend-design skill will choose an appropriate aesthetic")
  - "Minimal & refined" (description: "Clean, spacious, elegant, restrained color palette")
  - "Bold & maximalist" (description: "Vibrant colors, strong typography, rich visuals")
  - "Professional/corporate" (description: "Trust-building, conventional, accessible")
  - "Retro-futuristic" (description: "Nostalgic tech aesthetics with modern execution")

**{PREVIOUS_CHOICE_SUFFIX}**: If previous aesthetic was detected from design-spec.md, append to question: "(Previous: {aesthetic})"

**Question 4: Interactivity**
- Header: "Interactivity"
- Question: "What level of interactivity should the prototypes include? {PREVIOUS_CHOICE_SUFFIX}"
- Multi-select: false
- Options:
  - "Basic interactions (Recommended)" (description: "Hover states, click feedback, basic animations")
  - "Static HTML only" (description: "No JavaScript, pure CSS for faster loading")
  - "Full interactivity" (description: "Forms, state management, animations, micro-interactions")

**{PREVIOUS_CHOICE_SUFFIX}**: If previous interactivity was detected from design-spec.md, append to question: "(Previous: {interactivity})"

### 3.5. Check for Existing Prototypes

Before creating new prototypes, check if prototypes already exist:

1. **Construct prototype directory path**: `prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/`
2. **Check for existing HTML files** using Glob tool:
   ```
   Glob with pattern="*.html" path="prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/"
   ```
3. **If HTML files found**:
   - Count the number of prototype components
   - Check if `design-spec.md` exists in the same directory
   - Store the existing prototype directory path for potential backup
   - Present warning to user via AskUserQuestion:

**Overwrite Warning Question:**
- Header: "Existing prototypes"
- Question: "This PRD already has [N] prototype component(s). What would you like to do?"
- Multi-select: false
- Options:
  - "Create timestamped backup and generate fresh (Recommended)" (description: "Moves prototype-ui/ to prototype-ui-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/, then generates new prototypes. Safe and preserves history.")
  - "Cancel - keep existing prototypes" (description: "Stop here without making changes. You can manually rename or delete the folder if needed.")

4. **Handle user choice**:
   - If "Cancel" selected: Exit gracefully with message: "Prototype generation cancelled. Existing prototypes preserved at `prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/`"
   - If "Create backup" selected: Proceed to Step 3.6
   - If no existing prototypes found: Skip to Step 3.7 (Read Previous Design Choices)

### 3.6. Create Timestamped Backup (Conditional)

**Only runs if user selected "Create timestamped backup" in Step 3.5**

1. **Generate timestamp**: Use format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (e.g., `20260213-143022`)
2. **Construct backup path**: `prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui-backup-<timestamp>/`
3. **Move existing directory** using Bash tool:
   ```bash
   mv "prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui" "prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui-backup-<timestamp>"
   ```
4. **Store backup path** for use in final report (Step 8)
5. **Confirm success**: Verify the move completed without errors
6. **Proceed to Step 3.7**

### 3.7. Read Previous Design Choices (Optional)

**Attempt to preserve design choices from previous prototypes**

1. **Check for design-spec.md** in either:
   - Backup directory (if backup was just created in Step 3.6)
   - Current prototype-ui directory (if it wasn't backed up but was detected)

2. **If design-spec.md found**, read it and extract:
   - **Aesthetic direction** — Look for "**Aesthetic:**" under "## Design Direction"
   - **Fidelity level** — Look for "**Fidelity:**" under "## Design Direction"
   - **Interactivity level** — Look for "**Interactivity:**" under "## Design Direction"

3. **Parse the values**:
   - Aesthetic examples: "bold-futuristic", "minimal-refined", "professional-corporate", "retro-futuristic", "let-designer-decide"
   - Fidelity examples: "low", "medium", "high"
   - Interactivity examples: "static", "basic-interactions", "full-interactivity"

4. **Store parsed values** to pre-fill the questions in Step 3 (Interactive Discovery)

**Important**: If design-spec.md doesn't exist or is malformed, gracefully skip this step and proceed with fresh questions.

**Note**: This step conceptually happens *before* asking the user questions in Step 3, so the implementation should check for existing prototypes and read design choices *before* presenting the AskUserQuestion in Step 3. The step numbering reflects execution order.

### 4. Create Output Directory

- Derive output path: `prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/`
- Create the directory if it doesn't exist using Write tool (write a placeholder file if needed, then remove it)

### 5. Generate Prototypes Using Frontend-Design Principles

For each selected component:

**Apply the frontend-design skill methodology:**

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

## Implementation

Apply these principles to create production-quality HTML/CSS/JS code:
- Honor the fidelity level (low/medium/high) from user discovery
- Implement interactivity level (static/basic/full) from user discovery
- Respect aesthetic direction from user discovery or PRD context
- Save to `prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/<component-name>.html` (kebab-case)
- Include proper DOCTYPE, meta tags, accessibility attributes, semantic HTML
- Each file should be complete and standalone with embedded CSS and JavaScript

After each component, provide progress feedback: "✓ Generated prototype for <component-name>"

### 6. Generate Design Specification

Create a markdown file documenting the design decisions:

Path: `prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/design-spec.md`

Content structure:
```markdown
# Design Specification — <Feature Name>

**Generated:** <date>
**Source PRD:** `<path-to-prd>`

## Overview

<1-2 sentence summary of the prototype set>

## Components

### <Component 1 Name>
- **File:** `<component-1>.html`
- **Purpose:** <from PRD>
- **User Flow:** <from PRD>
- **Key Features:** <bullet list>

### <Component 2 Name>
...

## Design Direction

**Aesthetic:** <chosen aesthetic>
**Fidelity:** <chosen fidelity level>
**Interactivity:** <chosen interactivity level>

## Rationale

<Brief explanation of why this aesthetic/fidelity combination was chosen based on PRD context>

## Technical Notes

<Any framework constraints, browser requirements, accessibility features>

## Next Steps

- Review prototypes in browser by opening `index.html`
- Gather stakeholder feedback
- Use as reference for implementation (see `tasks.md` if generated)
```

### 7. Generate Index File

Create an HTML index for easy navigation:

Path: `prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/index.html`

Content structure (responsive, clean HTML):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title><Feature Name> - UI Prototypes</title>
    <style>
        /* Clean, minimal styling for the index */
        * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }
        body {

        }
        .component-card {

### 8. Summary Report

Provide a comprehensive summary including backup information (if applicable):

```markdown
✅ **Prototype generation complete**

{IF_BACKUP_CREATED}
📂 **Backup created:**
   - Old prototypes saved to: `prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui-backup-<timestamp>/`

📦 **Generated prototypes:**
   - prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/<component-1>.html
   - prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/<component-2>.html
   - ... (list all components)
   - prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/design-spec.md
   - prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/index.html

{IF_DESIGN_CHOICES_PRESERVED}
🎨 **Design choices preserved:**
   - Aesthetic: <aesthetic> (from previous prototype)
   - Fidelity: <fidelity> (from previous prototype)
   - Interactivity: <interactivity> (from previous prototype)

📖 **Next steps:**
   1. Open `prd/<feature-name>/prototype-ui/index.html` in browser to review prototypes
   {IF_BACKUP_CREATED}2. Compare with backup if needed: `prototype-ui-backup-<timestamp>/`
   {ENDIF}
   3. Run `/prd-export prd/<feature-name>/prd.md` to create stakeholder summary
   4. Run `/prd-tasks prd/<feature-name>/prd.md` to generate implementation tasks
```

**Template Variables:**
- `{IF_BACKUP_CREATED}`: Include this section only if a backup was created in Step 3.6
- `{IF_DESIGN_CHOICES_PRESERVED}`: Include this section only if previous choices were detected in Step 3.7
- Replace `<timestamp>`, `<aesthetic>`, `<fidelity>`, `<interactivity>` with actual values

## Operating Principles

- **Always read the PRD first** — Extract as much context as possible before asking questions
- **Ask focused questions** — Don't ask about things already clear in the PRD
- **Generate incrementally** — Create and save one component at a time, showing progress
- **Handle errors gracefully** — If frontend-design fails for one component, continue with others
- **Provide clear feedback** — Show what's being created and where files are saved
- **Create professional output** — The index and design spec should be stakeholder-ready
- **Respect user choices** — Honor the aesthetic and fidelity preferences exactly
- **Avoid duplication** — If components overlap, ask the user to clarify scope
- **Save incrementally** — Don't wait to save all components at the end
