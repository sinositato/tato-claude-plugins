# PRD Tasks Skill

Extracts functional requirements from a PRD and generates an implementation task breakdown. Tasks are grouped by priority (P0/P1/P2), include complexity estimates (S/M/L), dependency tracking, and acceptance criteria references.

## Usage

```
/prd-tasks <path-to-prd.md>
```

## Output

`prd/<feature-name>/tasks.md`
