# PRD Validate Skill

Lightweight lint and structural consistency check for a PRD. Faster than full `/prd-analyze` — checks section presence, metadata completeness, placeholder markers, requirement formatting, and table integrity. Returns pass/fail with specific issues.

## Usage

```
/prd-validate <path-to-prd.md>
```

## Output

Terminal report (read-only, no files modified).
